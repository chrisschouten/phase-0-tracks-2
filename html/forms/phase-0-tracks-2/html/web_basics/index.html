<h1>The Odd Cat</h1>

<p>This is the legend of <strong>Zuzu the Odd</strong>.</p>
<h2>Why was she so odd, you ask?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Zuzu would often bark for no good reason.</li>
	<li>Zuzu had a tendency to make daily bids for freedom.</li>
	<li>Zuzu would often indulge in hunting human toes in the middle of the night, to her owners displeasure.</li>

</ul>
<p>One day her owner did not shut the door all the way when leaving for work. Zuzu had a choice to make:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To make her first successful bid for freedom.</li>
	<li>To go back to bed and nap for eight hours.</li>
</ol>

<p>Zuzu wisely chose <em>option two</em> and lived happily ever after.</p>
