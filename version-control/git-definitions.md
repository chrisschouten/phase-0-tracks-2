# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way to keep track of the history of changes that are made by you or others as well as a way to merge code. It is useful because it shows your proccess and allows you to go back and make changes or go back to a concept that was unused. Also it is great for backup. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a version of your code that can be updated and synced back into the original. It is used as a way for one or more developers to create copies and make changes to code or projects without disturbing the original. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is used to save changes and add them to the repository. A good commit message explains exactly what kind of changes were made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict can occur when for example 2 developers change the same line of code. Git can get confused and you might have to do it manually. The good thing is that if you do something wrong during a merge, it can be undone.
